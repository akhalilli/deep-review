## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Deep learning, which describes a class of machine learning algorithms focussing on the training of deep artificial neural networks, has recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains.
Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well-suited to solve problems of these fields.
We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems---patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients---and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges.
As a result from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art.
Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation.
However, deep learning models are still regarded as black box algorithms, and more work is needed to address the common concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem.
Furthermore, the limited amount of labeled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records.
Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.
